# Vision_recognizer

In this project, I try to implement a real time vision recognizer. It's been a long time since I wanted to integrate deep nerual network with openCV. But for some reason, mac is unable to use many features of openCV.
But I just finally got it work by creating a virtual space on my laptop.

The project is to be continued..
